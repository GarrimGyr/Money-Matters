              <h2>The Great 'Northern-Triangle' Migration</h2>
              </div>
              <p>The number of refugees and asylum-seekers from the northern countries in Central America has soared in the past 5 years,
              and studies show that food security, violence, and climate variability are factors for why people flee.
              With over 47,000 asylum-seekers from Central America worldwide, the phenomenon of migration out of destitution from Central America is likely to increase in 2021.
              This research explores the factors that drive people in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to consider and decide to migrate irregularly or regularly,
              as well as the cost and economic implications of migration for households and communities throughout the region.
              We will examine how remittances impact daily life for families living in the Northern Triangle. <br><br>
              We will look at households that have had a member migrate, divided by whether or not they receive remittances,
              in order to better understand the specific changes in daily life that remittances enable.
              71% of families in the Northern Triangle that have had a family member
              migrate outside of the home country receive remittances. </p>
